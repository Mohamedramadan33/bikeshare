# bikeshare
In this project, I will be using Python to explore data related to bike sharing systems for three major US cities - Chicago, New York, and Washington. I will write code to import data and answer interesting questions about it by calculating descriptive statistics. I will also write a script that takes raw input to create an interactive experience in the device to present these stats.
